## About
On this site you can watch videos (movie clips) and improve your foreign language skills.

Just set up your native language and find a video in your target language

## How does it work?
When you didn't understand something while watching, just go back and subtitles in the primary language will appear.

If you still have no idea, go back again and you will see subtitles in your native language.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
