"They say that everything around you
becomes quiet,


00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.420
in the Moment of death."


00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.860
Cover!


00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.660
Open fire on my command.
We need to shoot.


00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.620
On my command!


00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.900
"That is Friedhelm, my Brother."


00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.060
"He won't be
much of a help anymore."

<i><b>Our Mothers, our Fathers

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.900
"Six months ago
in Berlin


00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.180
we said Good Bye
to our parents."


00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.300
"A human live."


00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.740
I expect of you
to do us all proud.


00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.820
Its about nothing less
than the future of Germany.


00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.460
You've already proven yourself.


00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.900
And you,
you stick to your brother.


00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.140
Maybe something will
become of you.


00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.460
You are going to take all of them?


00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.940
Yeah, sure.


00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.580
Hurry up, the girls are waiting.


00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.860
Take care.


00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.660
Wilhelm.


00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.660
You bring him back to me.
Promise.


00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.100
Promise!
I promise.


00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.900
<i>Bring the Unteroffizier
another Korn and the bill.</i>


00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.380
Then you call it a day.


00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.540
Won't your Soldier get a kiss?


00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.260
If I fall tomorrow,
your heart will be broken.


00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.260
If you fall,
then only in the gutter.


00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.540
Good night.
Good night.


00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.100
Greta.


00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.700
So?


00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.580
I did it.


00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.140
I knew it. Come!


00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.580
It's time to party.


00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.460
With an A, what else.


00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.980
Even though they wanted to trick me.


00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.500
They asked me what
came after the Third Reich.


00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.460
Nothing.


00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.940
The millenial kingdom
remains eternal.


00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.420
Just a few days until
I go to the front.


00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.180
Did you tell him,
that you love him?


00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.980
Stop it.
You've got to tell Wilhelm.


00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.100
We're at war,
life can be pretty short.


00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.780
<i>Do you want to wait until ultimate victory?</i>


00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.020
The few months.


00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.380
There they are.


00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.620
All right,
I'm going to tell him today.


00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.460
You can use my room.
Greta!


00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.300
What?


00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.980
Ladies.


00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.220
Na.


00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.140
Don't you have any luggage?
Luggage?


00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.980
<i>This Man is a Leutnant -
it will be picked up.</i>


00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.580
I understand.
Where is Viktor?


00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.700
<i>Schalom, Volksgenossen.
Schalom.</i>


00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.660
Where's your luggage?
"We were five. Five friends."


00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.220
Since when do you have a bicycle?
Stolen.


00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.060
"We wanted to bid our farewells,
before we parted ways."


00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.740
To us. - To us.
- To us.


00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.620
"We grew up in the same neighborhood


00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.980
and knew each other,
since we were kids."


00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.840
"We could not have been more different"


00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.380
"But we were friends that
sticked together."


00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.540
"Charly, our runt,


00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.340
wants do do her duty
for the Fatherland."


00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.740
"She will work
in a military hospital,


00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.740
which follows my unit
behind the front."


00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.660
"Viktor Goldstein."


00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.300
<i>"His father, a tailor, was a
Unteroffizier in the First World war"</i>


00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.580
"Viktor was supposed to
take over the business,


00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.020
<i>before it was shattered
in the Reichskristallnacht."</i>


00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.580
"This is his girlfriend Greta.
They are inseperable."


00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.700
"Greta does not mind,


00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.260
that their relationship is considered
to be racial defilement."


00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.500
"She is going to be a star."


00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.700
"The new Marlene Dietrich."


00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.580
"My younger Brother Friedhelm."


00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.740
"The Bookworm,
who loves Rimbaud and Jünger."


00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.060
"I admire him for his
intelligence and his wit."


00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.020
"For him, it's the first time."


00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.780
"And here am I, Wilhelm Winter."


00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.020
<i>"Leutnant of the Greyhound Company."</i>


00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.140

Swing-Music


00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.460
Friedhelm, give it to me!


00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.740
The War will make
a man out of him.


00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.980
The War will bring out
the worst of us.


00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.380
If you lose, they'll say
it'll be our fault again.


00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.940
This is no country for weaklings.
Everyone has to make sacrifices.


00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:24.340
Ah!


00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.020
Wilhelm...


00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.860
Knocking


00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.540
Hide.
No.


00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.620
If they find out that
you're here in spite of the curfew.


00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.260
you'd go to a camp
and we'd go with you.


00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.740
Same rights for everyone.
Selfishness is treason to the fatherland.


00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.860
Isn't it?
Yes.


00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.020
<i>Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.</i>


00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.780
How can I help you?


00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.020
May I?


00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.060
A farewell party.
We're leaving for the east tomorrow.


00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.060
Wilhelm Winter.
This is my brother Friedhelm.


00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.200
Miss Charlotte
will serve as a nurse on the frontlines.


00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.940
You stay at the homefront?


00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.340
It seems there has been a call,
Somebody is listening to Swing.


00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.300
With Jews.


00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.660
With Jews?
We wouldn't tolerate something like that.


00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.740
Teddy Stauffer.


00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.740
I didn't know that
Swing was prohibited.


00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.140
Your Name?
Greta Müller.


00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.580
<i>Incitement of hatred, Fräulein Müller.</i>


00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.100
Report yourself in the

<i>To the ultimate victory.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.820
Heil Hitler.


00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.220
A drink?
Yes.


00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.580
What?
You flirted with him.


00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.580
<i>I saved you,
you Schmendrik.</i>


00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.380
Greta, we have to go.


00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.580
Now? Charly wanted to...


00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.060
That can wait.
The war's over on christmas.


00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.540
Yeah, let's vow


00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.620
We'll be here again on christmas
here in this room.


00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.620
Alive.
Christmas in Berlin.


00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.700
Christmas in Berlin.
Christmas in Berlin.


00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.300
I'm going to take another photo.
Go there.


00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.420
There in front the shelf.
Come on.


00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.100
Here?
Yes, take a chair.


00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.620
Friedhelm,
go in front, next to Greta.


00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.020
"We were five friends."


00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.180
"We were young and we knew
that the future belonged to us."


00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.060
"The whole world laid before us
We just had to grab it."


00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.140
"We were invincible."


00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.700
"We should know better soon."


00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.460
"July 10th 1941."


00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.940
"This war will be different
to all other wars before."


00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.580
"It's a joy to push forward."


00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.140
"The frenzy of speed.
To go further and further and further."


00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.540
"The endlessness of space."


00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.060
"Landscapes like we've never
seen before."


00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.140
"Fields extending to the horizon."


00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.580
"The sky so far and blue,


00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.140
as if God wanted to bedazzle us
with the beauty of his creation."


00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.460
Isn't that great?
Soon here'll be german farms.


00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.500
"My men are putting up flawlessly."


00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.220
"On every mission
they're always at the forefront."


00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.180
"Everyone except Friedhelm,


00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.820
who everyone considers to be a coward,
who provokes me daily.


00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.060
who I feel ashamed of."


00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.700
How far is it to Moscow?
- About 700 Kilometers.


00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.580
Let's drive through,
we're the greyhounds.


00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.580
Breakfast on the Red Square
with Vodka and Caviar.


00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.860
And how are you going to
become a hero then?


00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.420
Didn't get a single russian and
already wants to have won the war.


00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.500
Well, if the russians
surrender all the time?


00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:17.460
Shall I shoot captives?


00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.100
Winter here would rather
tell them poems.


00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.980
Koch, how many do you have?
- Koch has at least ten already.


00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.100
Then Freitag will send his wife
a postcard from the red square tomorrow.


00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.780
It's not going to be that bad


00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.820
You coming?


00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.220
He's just going to give you a real ticking off.


00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.140
And why should I report in
personally then?


00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.940
I already testified.


00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.940
I'd come with you,
but my train doesn't wait.


00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.020
All right, I'll manage.
I'm sure you will.


00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.140
Charly!
How do I look?


00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.100
Like a movie star.


00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.180
Miss Müller, please.


00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.140
How are your friends?
Any news from the front?


00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.020
Only victories.


00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.540
So, you love swing?


00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.380
I like it modern.


00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.940
Reich Secretary of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels


00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.300
calls Swing
degenerate Nigger music.


00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.820
We all... can be mistaken.


00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.340
I agree with you.


00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.380
Cigarette?


00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.700
Thanks.


00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.380
I've read your testimony.


00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.380
You have sung?
Yes.


00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.980
I have good connections
to state broadcasting.


00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.820
Maybe something can be arranged.


00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.580
That would be wonderful.


00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.460
Marlene Dietrich...
We shouldn't mention her.


00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.060
Maybe you could sing
a song to me sometime?


00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.940
<i>Hauptmann Feigl.
Wilhelm.</i>


00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.060
Six Kilometers northeast.
A pocket of resistance in a factory.


00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.060
The company circumvents it
and continues.


00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.660
You take your best men
and smoke it out.


00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.100
Afterwards you'll advance to us.
- Jawohl.


00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.060
Good luck.


00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.860
The factory site
has to be cleared...


00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.140
<i>Jawohl, Herr Leutnant.
Then lets go!</i>


00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.500
Now it's hunting time!


00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:05.460
<i>Jawohl, Hauptoffizier.</i>


00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.460
Let's whack the Ivan.


00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.180
Welcome,
I am head nurse Brigitte.


00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.580
Hildegard.
Charlotte, my pleasure.


00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.260
Come in.
I'll show you everything.


00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.300
Here are the light casualties.


00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.100
The severely injured
are in Section A.


00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.020
In C are the contagious cases.


00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.900
What did this used to be?
A station for women in childbed.


00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.140
You know, why you're here?


00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.340
To serve the german soldiers.


00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.980
<i>These are the new nurses.
Oberfeldarzt Dr. Jahn.</i>


00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.500
I need you in the OR.
- Right away, Dr. Jahn.


00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.820
No private contact with
the soldiers.


00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.940
Especially not with the doctors.


00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.980
If I hear about anything
I'll have you transferred.


00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.100
We represent
the german woman.


00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.500
Serve the german soldiers.
Sounds promising.


00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.180
Hildegard...


00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.620
Four or five
up there in the factory.


00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.900
Heavy MG, a Maxim.


00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.700
We've told them to surrender.


00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.620
Machine gun.


00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.820
Were going with two fireteams,
I need to men.


00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.740
Any volunteers?


00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.140
<i>Bartel, Schmidt, with the Leutnant.</i>


00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.740
The LMG will provide suppressive fire.


00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.540
Give Schmidt your rifle, you buffoon.


00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.420
Freitag, Koch and Verbinsky with me.


00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.500
Show them what you're made of!


00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.900
<i>Schweiß für Blut!
- March!</i>


00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.980
Spannungsvolle Musik


00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.060
Maschinengewehrschüsse


00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.320
Go, go, go, go!


00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.500
Maybe we've got them all.


00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.740
Or maybe they're calling
Comrade Stal-


00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.040
Cover!


00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.860
Sch-sch-sch.


00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.060
Schmidt, hang in there.


00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.260
Bartel, go!


00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.460
Go, go, go!


00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.180
Shall I shoot?


00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.900
Tell me, goddamnit!


00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.220
Goddamn jewish bolshevik bastard!


00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.860
Schneider, pull yourself together!
Schmidt could still be alive.


00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.900
But he...
No buts! Get the MG from upstairs.


00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.780
<i>Jawohl, Herr Leutnant.</i>


00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.220
Where is Freitag?
The medic is treating him.


00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:03.980
Get the men to the truck.


00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.860
<i>He is one of those Commissars.
He will be interrogated, understood?</i>


00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.660
Bring them away!


00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.420
You heard it, men.


00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.980
Verbinsky.


00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.140
Look!
That's for the cook sergeant.


00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.660
I have a recipe for a meat soup
from my grandmother.


00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.740
Come, Schnitzel.
Come. Come, Schnitzel.


00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.700
Door opens


00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.900
This seam here, it's skewed.
You have to open it up again.


00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:30.540
And here, this cuff as well.


00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.540
Is that everything?


00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.100
A good work
will always stay a good work.


00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.620
Were not humans anymore
for them


00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.100
You're exaggerating.
Why should they forego us?


00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.300
When we've won the war,
everything will calm down.


00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.220
Since when is this our war?


00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.540
I have always served Germany
well and faithfully.


00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.860
That will not be forgotten.


00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.380
Are you still meeting that girl?


00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.100
Why?
You know its prohibited.


00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.060
Do you trust her?


00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.980
Moaning


00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.260
Charly has written.
She says the war is splendid.


00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.660
You grow stronger and harder.


00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.220
And that we're going to
celebrate christmas together.


00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.700
Her military hospital is pretty close
to Wilhelms unit.


00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.460
I'm going to the american
embassy tomorrow.


00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.500
Why?


00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.300
When I'm famous I'll make sure
that nothing happens to you.


00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.820
Heinz Rühmann has
a jewish wife as well.


00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.780
Heinz Rühmann has divorced his jewish wife.


00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.540
What did he want?


00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.180
Trust me.


00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.900
Screams of agony.


00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.740
Aaah!


00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.940
Clamp.


00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.100
Compress. Quick,
this man is going to bleed out!


00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.260
Scalpel.


00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.100
Out! Out with you!
Get lost!


00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.700
It seems the comrades have understood
the superiority of the aryan race.


00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.100
This is a present from the Führer.


00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.060
Here. This is just the appetizer.
Afterwards there'll be Schnitzel.


00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.700
And from the rest of the calf
there'll be ribs.


00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.340
<i>There will be soup, cook.
Jawohl, Herr Leutnant.</i>


00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.060
Friedhelm.


00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:33.900
Why are you doing that?


00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:37.700
<i>What? Did I forgot to salute,
Leutnant?</i>


00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.540
You damn well know what!


00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.100
You never volunteer.


00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.300
For the battle against the
international finance jewry?


00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.060
I thought one hero in the family
was enough.


00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.620
I'm not your brother here,
but your superior.


00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.580
You know, what they think about you.


00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.980
I could protect you from father.
- I never asked you for this


00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.060
If you want me to be in a fireteam,
then assign me to one.


00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.900
We drink a last time
to Schmidt.


00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.100
Winter, you can carve a notch
into your stock as well.


00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.860
If you need a kill,
just lend us your rifle.


00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:32.540
Have you heard anything from Freitag?
- He is in the military hospital.


00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.900
<i>Nice Work, Leutnant.
Thanks, Herr Hauptmann.</i>


00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.500
Shall I inform Schmidts parents?


00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.580
I'm doing that right now.


00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.980
The russian commissar was interrogated.


00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.420
Completely fanatic.
He says, that we will never win.


00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.980
He can be shot now.


00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.340
The man is a prisoner of war.
You know the order.


00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.100
The Soviets did not sign
the Geneva Convention.


00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.820
Commissars are to be executed immediately.


00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.900
That is not a normal war,
but an ideology.


00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.100
Do it somewhere off,
so the men won't brutalize.


00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.620
Gun fire


00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.900
Here you are.


00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.580
That can happen to anyone.


00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.460
On my first operation I mixed up
the clamps and the scissors.


00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.260
Did he make it?


00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:23.100
Better make it two centimeters less.
Stay still.


00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.900
And the neckline has to -
- reach the navel, I know.


00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.460
Now stay still.


00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.380
How long are you going to need?
All right, I'll stay still.


00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.900
We can't continue like this.
There are rumors.


00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.340
Rumors?


00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.940
The Jews
will be sent east.


00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.220
Were you at the american embassy?


00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.260
There are no new numbers.


00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.300
Nobody gets out anymore.


00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.980
Turn around.


00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.380
<i>Is it true that the Leutnant had to
execute the captive?</i>


00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.580
Yeah, that's true.


00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.060
I hope that Stalin
holds out a little longer.


00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.460
When the russian capitulates tomorrow,
we'll never get to Moscow.


00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.940
All of them would come home
with neat uniforms and medals.


00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.900
And me? I'd just be a normal civilian.


00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.860
Ist doch so, oder?


00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.140
His whole life, my old man was never further than
ten kilometers away from his farm.


00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.140
And I am a thousand away.
And you know why?


00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.300
The Führer said that
when the war is won,


00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.860
there will be land here in the east
for every one of us.


00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.020
I'll find myself a woman and stay here.


00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:14.460
It will be fertilized quite well...
...with our blood.


00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.300
Not with yours, Winter.


00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.020
You duck your head,
as soon as the Ivan lets one loose.


00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.580
I just want to defer to you,
Schneider,


00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.780
when you're that keen on getting an iron cross, huh?


00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.060
What?


00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.980
What did you say?


00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.140
Attention!


00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:48.140
Call it off for today.
We're leaving at six.


00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.760
It's going to be a hard day tomorrow.
Good night.


00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.580
Go to sleep men,
tomorrow at six we'll be starting.


00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.380
<i>Goddamnit... That with the Leutnant...
- Koch, he did it for us.</i>


00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.420
Not for me.


00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.100
Otherwise one of us
would have had to have done it.


00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.340
No, we wouldn't.


00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.460
Do you think the Russian would
do it differently?


00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:21.900
Maybe he is learning from us.


00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.980
What did you learn?
Head nurse, I don't know...


00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.700
Do you think it's enough,
to pledge loyalty to the Fuhrer,


00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.340
and suddenly you're a nurse?


00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.180
It won't happen again.
Bedpans and changing bandages.


00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.660
There are ukranians waiting outside.
Select an assistant.


00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.900
Who is experienced
with sick and injured people?


00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.420
Who speaks german?


00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.220
What is a syringe?


00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.100
For injections.


00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.860
In the hat?


00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.020
Yes.


00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:24.060
But if the hat is sick,
it won't be healed with just that.


00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.780
You're experienced with sick people?
Yes.


00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:33.980
Are you jewish?


00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.860
No.


00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.900
Good, come with me.


00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:43.420
<i>The others... Davai!</i>


00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:00.500
Where were you last night?
Were you with that girl again?


00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:04.140
What are you doing?


00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:07.180
The newest Idea by
Herrn Doktor Joseph Goebbels.


00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.340
We all have to wear it now.


00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.860
It's a law.
Even if it's wrong


00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.340
a good German
does not violate the law.


00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.940
Here, Thread Number 3.
We are no Germans anymore.


00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.620
Not for them.


00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.460
Your arrogance
is going to cost you dear.


00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.500
Viktor.


00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.420
Viktor!


00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:36.060
What are you doing?
That's no way to speak to your father.


00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.860
There are so many things he doesn't understand anymore.
What?


00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.660
It's all right.


00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:10.180
Did you go to the embassy?
Yeah.


00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.460
As soon as they have new quotas,
we're on board.


00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.420
"September 19th, 1941."


00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:31.980
"We're arresting
hundred thousands of Russians."


00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:35.620
"But they don't give up,
they fight for every house."


00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.420
"The twitching of a colossus,
just about to fall."


00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:43.060
"I am optimistic, that we will
be back home by christmas."


00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.380
"And yet, its still a different
war from what I imagined."


00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.060
Security service is conducting
a cleansing operation here.


00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.540
The Order: Nobody gets in,
nobody gets out.


00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.020
What do we do if somebody
wants to get through?


00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.220
Shoot them.


00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.380
You like to shoot, don't you?


00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:41.820
When I was seven,
my dad got laid off.


00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.420
So we went to the woods, hunting.


00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.300
Only after the Führer came,
my dad got work again.


00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.020
There they are, finally.


00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.260
Auxiliary police. Ukranians.


00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:32.780
There are children present.
...they are not allowed to kill civilians.


00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.260
Hey!


00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.660
Stoj! Let her go!
What does 'immediately' mean?


00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.820
Sehtschassje.
- Sehtschassje.


00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.300
What's going on here?


00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.620
Let go!


00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.420
Apustijt.
Apustijt.


00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.140
<i>Herr Sturmbannführer.
Herr Leutnant.</i>


00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:32.660
That girl belongs to the security service.


00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.540
Like all civilians this girl is
under the control of the Wehrmacht.


00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.340
That's no civilian,
that's a jew.


00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.580
An order is an order.


00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.660
And your orders are to lead
a ukranian mob?


00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.380
How honorable
for a german officer.


00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.140
This girl is your responsibility
until I have sorted out this issue.


00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.220
Understood.


00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.100
<i>As you wish, Leutnant.
Herr Sturmbannführer.</i>


00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.980
I need papers.


00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.820
For a friend,
that has to leave germany.


00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.020
For a friend?


00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.260
Can you help him?


00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.140
Do you mean the jew?


00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:29.660
Believe me, that problem
is going to take care of itself.


00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.500
What do you mean with that?


00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:39.300
You better only worry about
the things you know about


00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.500
That problem is going to ta-


00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:45.740
I said, only worry about the things
you really know about.


00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.860
Are you doing well with your program?


00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.060
Yeah.


00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.820
Good.


00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.700
Believe me,


00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.900
I'll make a star out of you.


00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.460
Leningrad is trapped since
September 7th,


00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:24.700
Kiew will fall, and it's only
500 Kilometers to Moscow.


00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.660
High command assumes that the Russians
will do a last, desperate attempt


00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.860
to stop the middle army group


00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:35.260
Use the time to get your material
and weapons back to shape.


00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:39.300
<i>Leutnant Winter. A Word.</i>


00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.340
Are you crazy?


00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.180
<i>A Sturmbannführer
of security service.</i>


00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.980
He executed a child in front of my eyes.
- Where there's jews, theres partisans.


00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.260
We are waging a war.
That is no war.


00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.580
Yes it is. A new one.
In the name of the Fuhrer.


00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:02.660
If we lose this war,
not even god will save us.


00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.140
and most definitely not the Fuhrer.


00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.180
Then we must not
under any circumstances lose it.


00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.260
You're my best man.


00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:21.660
You can make it far.
Don't ruin your carreer.


00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.820
Wilhelm.


00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:33.820
We should bid farewell to
the world as we know it.


00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:44.220
She wasn't older than eleven.


00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.780
It's about the purity of our race.


00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.420
The jews are tainting
the blood of the germans.


00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.780
Fuck off, Schneider.
- It's in "Mein Kampf".


00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.260
You can read?


00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:00.620
We're defending our fatherland.


00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:04.180
And what are they doing over there?
Exactly the same thing.


00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.740
<i>Herr Sturmbannführer.
Leutnant.</i>


00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.860
I'm sorry about the mess earlier.
That was not necessary.


00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.620
But the jewish blood is so malicious,
it just spreads everywhere. Unpredictable.


00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.980
That's why the jews
are so dangerous.


00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.680
Achtung!


00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:12.420
Lilija, no!


00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.900
Better Doktor Jahn.
Grab.


00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.580
That's a broken upper arm.
We really have to wait for Dr. Jahn.


00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.220
Not Broken. Grab.
Here. Here!


00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:37.620
Not Broken.


00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.460
What do we have here?


00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.860
A dislocated shoulder.


00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:48.460
We have put it right ourselves.


00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.700
Good, Nurse Charlotte.


00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.780
You're slowly getting better.


00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.100
Thanks.


00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.420
Everythings quiet.
Ivan is shitting his pants.


00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.060
Don't think you can fall asleep, Winter.


00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.100
Yeah.


00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:24.820
A damn russian sewing-machine.
They've turned off the lights.


00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.980
Winter, put out your cigarette.


00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.420
Put down the cigarette!


00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.740
Winter you idiot!
You're gonna pay for this.


00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.140
You did that on purpose, Winter!


00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:33.260
<i>We have a dashing Artillary Leutnant on the A.</i>


00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.300
What? These man haven't seen
a woman for weeks.


00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.700
We're boosting the fighting power.
If they catch you...


00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.700
She's so much better than us.


00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.020
There's morphium missing again.


00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:00.260
Maybe she's working with the partisans?


00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.220
They say, they sneak into the
military hospitals at night.


00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:07.620
and kill soldiers that can't
defend themselves in their beds.


00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:11.580
And I even selected her...


00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:30.740
You're not only a disgrace
for the company,


00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.220
but for your brother as well.


00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.860
Say, Schneider...


00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.460
did anyone ever tell you that


00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.500
you look pretty jewish?


00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:53.500
Stop it!
Schneider, that's enough.


00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:05.460
Get him to the medic.


00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:22.940
Did you see her legs?


00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:25.460
Yeah.


00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.540
So?
So...


00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.460
Your's are more beautiful.
So it is.


00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:35.060
And I sing better than Marika Rökk
as well.


00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.460
The box seats were sold out.


00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:50.100
Darling, are you coming?
We're missing the newsreel.


00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:53.740
They're saying the russian
southwest front broke down.


00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.380
You were lucky.


00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:38.420
We can release you soon.


00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:43.220
In the Kiew cauldron,
five russian armies have surrendered.


00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:45.500
The military hospital
is going to be moved east.


00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:48.380
As soon as the 60th arrives,
we're leaving.


00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:53.740
The 60th? That's Wilhelms unit
isn't it?


00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.700
Does he talk about me from time to time?


00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.540
Yes.


00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.260
Disembark, men.


00:56:31.980 --> 00:56:34.460
<i>Leutnant Winter.
My orders are to...</i>


00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.180
I know, we'll be escorted.


00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.700
The number of partisans
has considerably increased.


00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:44.260
Because of our farsighted policy to
consider the indigenous population inferior


00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:03.620
Friedhelm.


00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.540
How are you?
Good.


00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:17.540
I'm happy to hear that.


00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.900
<i>Such a handsome Leutnant definitely
has a big lighter.</i>


00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.740
Wilhelm.


00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.740
Charly.


00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:49.940
How are you?
Good.


00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:52.740
You look great.
Thanks.


00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.700
Like a real front nurse.


00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:00.020
So, already found the right one
from all these men?


00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:04.940
Yes.


00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.940
Farewell, Charly.


00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.780
Take care of yourself.


00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.380
Christmas in Berlin.


00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:12.020
I have one hour.


00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:18.300
There are rumors that Himmler is
going to enact a regulation,


00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:22.380
that ultimately prohibits
the departure of jews.


00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.300
Tell him, the noose is tightened.


00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:33.980
And I warn you.


00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:37.220
Race betrayal is a crime.


00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:40.180
It's dangerous to have a jewish friend


00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.740
if you want to achieve something here.


00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.340
What's going on?


00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.780
You mean, more dangerous than
having an affair with a german


00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:53.940
if you have a wife and daughter?


01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:03.060
Do you have the papers?


01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.140
I need a photograph.


01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.620
Did you for...
Surprised?


01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:47.500
Have you finally
finished my dress?


01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.140
What for?
You're just going to take it off anyway.


01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:07.020
Since when am I accountable to you?


01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:11.380
A money-grabbing
hook-nosed jew.


01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.860
We're not engaged.


01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:16.380
You should be a little more thankful.


01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.060
"October 7th, 1941."


01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.260
"The rainy season has begun."


01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:56.940
"It's a flood that cripples
and brings everything to a halt."


01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.300
"The end of the Blitzkrieg."


01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:03.620
"As if god averted us for
all the horrors that we bring."


01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.780
"Maybe it's just the last test."


01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.340
What?


01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:27.460
He says we should stick to the left, and that
we need approximately 12 hours through the swamp.


01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:32.580
Left. So there?
Da.


01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.420
And partisans?
Njet.


01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.540
I don't trust him.


01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.300
All right, let's go.
On your feet, ladies.


01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.860
Dorgerloh, Schneider, Bartel with me.


01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.420
Winter, you lead the rest.


01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.620
I want to get out of this damn...


01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.500
What?


01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:27.340
Stay calm, Koch. Stay calm.
Don't move, Koch.


01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:29.140
Friedhelm.


01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.180
Friedhelm, come.


01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.860
Mines!


01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.580
Mines!
Retreat, Men. Everyone back.


01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.580
Come, Friedhelm.


01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:54.020
Greet... greet my sister.
Come on, now!


01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.300
And now get lost!


01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:33.100
Where is Nurse Hildegard?
Hildegard?


01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.540
Where were you this whole time?
- Emptying bedpans.


01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.020
There's morphium missing again.


01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.580
If you see anything...
theft is forbidden under penalty of death.


01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.900
And turn this up.


01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.580
Probably this whole swamp is mined.


01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.420
We have to go back and
send the combat engineers in.


01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.420
Then we'll get stuck here.


01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:50.580
My men are already demoralized.


01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:53.860
No preparations for the winter
have been made.


01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:57.300
If we're not in Moscow in six weeks,
we're going to freeze to death.


01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.220
Without engineers we lose
at least a third of our men.


01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.980
It doesn't have to be our men.


01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:13.340
Damnit, Winter, that's good.


01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:17.500
These damn farmers are all partisans anyway.
This guy sent us in there.


01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.940
Better them than us.


01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:33.540
Move, Move.
Move, you bastard.


01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:40.100
Everyone that stops or flees
gets shot.


01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.980
Do you hear that Ivan?
Do you hear that?


01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:50.900
Dawai! Dawai! Dawai!


01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:53.860
Marching row. Follow me.


01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:06.140
Do you remember our
last evening in Berlin?


01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.260
Us five.


01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:17.220
I was right.


01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.940
The war will only bring out
the worst of us.


01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.340
Dawai. Dawai. Dawai.
Move!


01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:44.220
You're so quiet. Everything ok?
Bad news?


01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.860
You lied to me.


01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.900
You're a doctor.


01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:56.380
Yes.
And a jew.


01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:03.020
Yes.


01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:21.260
Headnurse.


01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:31.980
"...only beats for you."


01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:35.700
His name is Hans Müller and he's traveling
to Paris on behalf of the IG Farben.


01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:39.460
Written and signed by
the defense inspection 3.


01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.500
And he should hurry.


01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:46.020
From Paris he has to make it
to the unoccupied part.


01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.060
To Marseille.


01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.220
After that he's on his own.


01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:03.500
Thanks.
If I see him again...


01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.300
You won't.


01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:36.700
"December 1941.
three meters high snow."


01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.840
"Minus 40 Degrees Celsius."


01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.420
"Water, that turns to ice
in seconds."


01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:45.000
"The assault on Moscow
has failed,


01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.820
and we are not prepared
for the Winter."


01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.500
"We have dug into the
rock-hard ground."


01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.120
"As deep as possible,
like animals in caves,


01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.400
who are afraid of freezing to death."


01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:58.140
"Nothing turned out
the way we imagined."


01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.840
What do you have here, Winter?


01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:09.460
Keep controlling the guards, Bertok.


01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.820
Are you crazy?


01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.940
I just wanted to burn it
to warm myself.


01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.660
We don't even have snowshirts.


01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:34.660
Every Russian can see us from a thousand
meters away and shoot us like dogs.


01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:38.220
Dogerloh is organizing Bedsheets
from the population.


01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.900
Why are you helping us?


01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:22.220
The enemy.


01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:27.100
I help people.
You're doing that as well, don't you?


01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:38.220
Why don't you tell?
What?


01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:43.260
The handsome, young man.
Why don't you tell him?


01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:48.540
It's not that easy.


01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.900
You love him a long time?


01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:56.820
Yes.


01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.620
And always silent? He knows?


01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:03.500
I don't know.


01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.580
I don't think so.


01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.220
Men never know, always only fighting.


01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.100
And you?


01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:26.540
I not hear anything from him
since July.


01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:37.580
Maybe you should leave.


01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:40.140
Why?


01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.180
Nothing... It's all right.


01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.540
Hitler has declared
war on America.


01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:18.380
When he starts a war
then properly.


01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.780
That's going to
break his neck eventually.


01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:24.700
We shouldn't have read the
Torah.


01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:26.740
but their bible.


01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:30.660
You never read the Torah,
you always wanted to be a Schmock.


01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.500
Lay down.
I'll make you a cup of tea.


01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.820
Viktor.


01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.460
You were right.


01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.740
Your german friend was there.


01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:14.420
She brought this.


01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.180
And she said,


01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:22.700
tomorrow at 9.56 AM.
at Bahnhof Friedrichstraße


01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.780
Merry Christmas.


01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.580
Say, Charly in the military hospital...


01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:44.180
...did she say anything there?


01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:46.860
You mean, about you?


01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:49.660
Doesn't matter, forget it.


01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:56.340
Wilhelm.


01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:01.500
She speaks of you the whole time.
Only of you.


01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.780
Why don't you just tell her?


01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:13.500
Hm?


01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:16.820
Oh, I understand. You don't
want to give her any hope,


01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:20.780
because you don't know if you
come back alive.


01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:45.260
Do you still have your photo?


01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:47.700
Of course.


01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:50.340
Do you remember,


01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.220
you said, that the war would
be over by chrismas.


01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:58.660
And then us five, together in Berlin.


01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.780
German christmas songs on the radio.


01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:25.580
Lilja, you have to go.
He needs new bandages.


01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:27.540
You have to go. Now!


01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:31.660
Sister Charlotte has reported,
that a Jew is hiding here.


01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:37.260
I'm sorry.


01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:26.980
When do you think,
it's going to start again?


01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.860
I don't know.


01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:36.260
Maybe when the snow melts.


01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:04.780
Mein Bubele. Mein Bubele.
Mein Bubele.


01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:19.420
No. He's sleeping.


01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:23.060
It would only break his heart.
You have to go now.


01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.500
Mein Bubele...


01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:31.140
You must only think about yourself, ok?
Do it for me, please.


01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.140
Go, go now, go.


01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:41.020
When I'm in New York,
I'll get you. Yes.


01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:46.420
Write...
Write, when you're there.


01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:54.460
Viktors Mother cries.


01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:53.380
Good Morning, Ladies.


01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:58.140
We need someone to carry our food.


01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:22.100
I'll do it.
- Good, Winter.


01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:28.740
<i>Herr Oberleutnant?</i>


01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:32.340
Is my brother back yet?
No.


01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.740
How long is he away now?


01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:44.580
More than three hours.


01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:58.020
Miss Müller?


01:24:59.620 --> 01:25:01.620
Del Torres.


01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:05.620
Miss Del Torres,
are you ready?


01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:10.180
Greta.


01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:13.660
Yes, of course.
I'm ready.


01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.500
Then, please.


01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.700
Recording.


01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:33.620
"My tiny heart"


01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:37.140
"only beats for you,"


01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:42.020
"counts the hours
until you come back,"


01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:45.140
"then you embrace me."


01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.260
"My tiny heart"


01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.460
"already dreams of luck."


01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:58.060
"At home it only waits for you"


01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:02.180
"and knows, you come back soon."


01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:06.420
"Lovingly,"


01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:09.620
"you look at me."


01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:14.580
"Our lips
touch each other very soft"


01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.660
"and I know, you're a man."


01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:22.500
"My tiny heart"


01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:26.220
"does not rest at ease."


01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:30.700
"It keeps me awake the whole night"


01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:34.740
"and it always beats, you,you"


01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:39.060
"My tiny heart"


01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:42.300
"longs for you,"


01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:47.140
"knows the answer,
if you ask me then."


01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:50.140
"Yes, I belong to you."


01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:56.740
"Yes, I belong to you."


01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:57.380
Bon voyage.


01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:17.220
Alarm!


01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.300
Go! Go! Go!


01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:24.060
March! March! March!


01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:26.780
Let's go, Men!


01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:32.020
Man that MG, go.


01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.340
That is, that is your brother!


01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.340
Request artillery!


01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:54.540
Cover!


01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:04.900
Don't shoot,
wait for my command!


01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:08.380
Don't shoot,
wait for my command!


01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:17.940
Open fire!


01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.620
"We were five. Five friends."


01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:37.820
"The whole world laid in front of us."


01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:42.140
"We just had to grasp it."


01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.980
"That's six months ago."


01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:48.340
"A human live."


01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:01.100
Friedhelm!
