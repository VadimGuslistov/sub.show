00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.040
Turn it off!


00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:42.542
Turn it off!


00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:49.758
OK, that's it for today!


00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:55.847
This is a brothel,
not a chorus line!


00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:58.600
You don't have to make the people think -


00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.685
You have to make them fuck!


00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:07.776
Now then -


00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:10.487
The doctor says to the man:


00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:13.615
You got two different testicles.


00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:17.285
One is made of wood,
and the other one is metal.


00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:21.331
The man is quite surprised,


00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.793
and the doctor doesn't know what to say either.


00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.879
But then he asks:
"Do you have children?"


00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:31.842
The man says: "Yes, two -


00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:36.054
Pinocchio is 3 and
Terminator will be 7 soon.


00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:44.896
That's the joke?


00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:47.482
Yes, damit!


00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:50.527
Who is "Ponocchio"?


00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:54.489
"Pinocchio" is a marionette
- made of wood.


00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.617
And "Terminator" is made of metal.


00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:02.080
- I don't understand your joke!
- Because you don't listen right!


00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.166
- I did!
- No, you didn't!


00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:07.502
I have to explain every joke to you
three times and you still don't get it!


00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.588
I understood your fucking joke!


00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.758
"Terminator" is a machine!


00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:14.843
- made of metal!


00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:20.015
But why is a child a marionette?


00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.015
Now, that's it!


00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.519
I'll never tell you a another
goddamned joke again!


00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.693
You will drive this car to Curtis,
give it to him and piss off.


00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.238
- OK, Boss!
- No, not OK!


00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.240
"Driving" means: You don't stop even once!


00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.743
But what if we have to take a piss?


00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:43.789
Then one of you morons will take a piss
and the other one stays in the car!


00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.958
You are never to take your eyes off the car!
Understood?


00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.794
Understood, boss - understood!


00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:51.838
Abdul, did you get that?


00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.966
Yes, no problem, boss! - No problem!


00:02:57.135 --> 00:03:00.305
OK, Hank, let's toss a coin:
If it's heads, I drive...


00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:01.848
Abdul!


00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.976
Hank will drive the car first!


00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.230
You can switch later,
but Hank will start now!


00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:13.110
Always Hank!


00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:26.039
Hey! Maybe you can wait until I get in?


00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.167
Be careful!
Idiots!


00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.039
Good day!


00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.167
I am here for the check-up.


00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:01.968
- Am I allowed to smoke?
- No, it is strictly forbidden!


00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.512
Damn...


00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.975
Mr. Wurlitzer?


00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:10.602
Rudi Wurlitzer?


00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:12.687
Come with me!


00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:15.816
- Please take off your clothes!
- Underwear too?


00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:18.026
No!
That's enough!


00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.320
Time for a urine sample!


00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.988
Nurse?


00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:24.074
I need a new cup -
this one is full!


00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.867
- Sorry, I can't.


00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:30.539
- Either you pee or I'll use a catheter!


00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.820
Take a deep breath
And...


00:06:02.446 --> 00:06:05.574
Hold it!


00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:11.329
No!


00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.584
I can't believe it!


00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:20.380
Yes, I always say:
Preventive Check-up!


00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:25.510
Where is it?
Here?


00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.848
Cut it out!


00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.393
We can do that


00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.896
What do you mean:
"We can do that"?


00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:39.983
That means that the tumour in your head
is already quite big.


00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:43.528
It is still growing and it's pressing on
your brain. It doesn't look good.


00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:47.282
You've come too late.


00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:02.381
How much time do I have left?


00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:04.591
Perhaps only days


00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:10.972
My father died of bone cancer, too.


00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.727
They dissected him piece by piece.


00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:17.562
- but it didn't help


00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:19.398
He died in the end.


00:07:19.898 --> 00:07:23.068
How long ago was that, Mr. Wurlitzer?


00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.820
20 years.


00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:28.240
Medicine has made some progress
in the last 20 years.


00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:33.370
Maybe technology is better now -


00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:36.581
- but you still can't cure
cancer or HIV.


00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:40.877
Yes, there will always be an
illness we can't cure.


00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:44.631
I understand that you are worried.


00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.717
Worried?


00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:52.639
You know, it's just the fact that -


00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:57.978
Death is a very unpleasant form of life.


00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:05.277
Come on!
Come on!


00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:17.873
Oh no!


00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.625
You are not allowed to do
whatever you want Mr. Brest!


00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:23.295
This is a hospital
and not an amusement park!


00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:27.382
Mr. Wurlitzer, this is your bed.
You can put your things in the locker.


00:08:27.382 --> 00:08:30.510
The doctor will stop by later.
You can rest now.


00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.349
The doctor will find out about the cigarettes
and you'll be in deep trouble!


00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:40.187
Nurse?


00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.856
Can you give me a blowjob?


00:08:42.856 --> 00:08:45.525
Or maybe bring me some tea?


00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:17.516
Franky said we can switch,
and now I want to drive!


00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.644
Goddamn it we're not even halfway there yet!


00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:25.565
Move over, or shall I blow you?


00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.151
God damn it!!


00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:31.822
- Hank, why do I always have to flip?
- It's "flip out"...


00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:57.264
This is automatic transmission.
You have to put it in "D"!


00:09:57.472 --> 00:09:59.558
I know!


00:10:04.438 --> 00:10:07.566
- Put it in "D"!
- I know!


00:10:07.816 --> 00:10:12.154
And it is "blow one's brains"
and not just "blow someone"!


00:10:12.696 --> 00:10:14.239
I know!


00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:37.721
What is going on?


00:10:37.721 --> 00:10:40.432
I just wanted to see if everything is alright.


00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:40.432
"If everything is alright"?


00:10:40.432 --> 00:10:48.148
You looked dead.
I don't want share a room with a dead man.


00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.026
I am not dead.


00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:53.236
I am still alive.


00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:55.447
Good for you!


00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:59.618
I've got a tumour in my head
as big as a tennis ball.


00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:01.703
I only got a few days left.


00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.794
They told you?


00:11:16.718 --> 00:11:18.804
I've got cancer -


00:11:18.804 --> 00:11:21.932
bone cancer.


00:11:24.643 --> 00:11:29.856
This must be the bite-the-dust section.
Some kind of broom closet.


00:11:41.535 --> 00:11:43.912
Maybe we should have asked?


00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:50.168
Oh sure! "Nurse, we need salt and lemons,
because we want to get drunk with Tequila!"


00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.353
Salt!


00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:21.450
Well done, Abdul!
It was a red light!


00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:21.450
I know!


00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.537
If you scratched the paint, Franky will kill us!


00:12:25.537 --> 00:12:28.665
You are completely nuts!


00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:33.045
Where did you come from?


00:12:33.045 --> 00:12:35.464
You assholes ran me over!


00:12:35.464 --> 00:12:37.090
My leg!


00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:39.259
Does it hurt?


00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.386
Yeah, Achmed!


00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.056
But nothing happened!


00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:45.849
Are you a fucking doctor?


00:12:45.891 --> 00:12:48.977
Come on boy, everything looks fine.


00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:51.605
Do you want a banana?


00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:59.529
I want you to take me to the hospital
with this car. Motherfuckers!


00:13:00.989 --> 00:13:04.117
This car has only two seats.


00:13:04.117 --> 00:13:07.245
Then ride in the trunk,
you can't drive anyway!


00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:11.750
Smoking!


00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:14.836
Smoking helps.


00:13:15.796 --> 00:13:17.881
Smoking?


00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.426
No, that's dangerous to your health!


00:13:22.677 --> 00:13:25.806
Do I have lung cancer?


00:13:35.107 --> 00:13:43.740
You stand on the beach and taste the salty
smell of the wind that comes from the ocean,


00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:50.622
and inside you feel the warmth
of never ending freedom,


00:13:52.916 --> 00:14:03.218
and on your lips the bitter,
tear- soaked kiss of your lover.


00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:08.557
I have never been to the ocean.


00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:16.565
That can't be true!


00:14:16.815 --> 00:14:19.901
You have never ever been to the ocean?


00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:23.989
Never - ever!


00:14:25.574 --> 00:14:29.828
Both of us are knocking on heavens door,
drinking tequila-


00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:34.624
- we are biting-the-dust experts-


00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:38.670
- and you have never - ever been to the ocean!


00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:42.132
Never - ever!


00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:46.595
Don't you know how it is
when you arrive in heaven?


00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:54.770
In heaven that's all they talk about -
the ocean - and how wonderful it is.


00:14:57.147 --> 00:15:05.489
They talk about the sunsets they have seen.
They talk about how the sun turned blood-red
before it set.


00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:09.868
And they talk about how they felt
when the sun was loosing its power,


00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:15.916
- and the cold that was coming from the ocean,
while the rest of the fire was still glowing.


00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:20.504
And you -


00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:26.051
You can't talk about it with them,
since you have never been there!


00:15:27.386 --> 00:15:31.556
You will be a fucking outsider up there!


00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:44.694
And there is nothing we can do about it?


00:15:55.539 --> 00:15:57.207
How did this happen?


00:15:57.207 --> 00:16:02.337
These two morons went through a red light
and hit me.


00:16:20.272 --> 00:16:24.526
Can you do me a favour please?
Don't let them go!


00:16:25.444 --> 00:16:29.114
- There will be trouble with the insurance.
- Sure.


00:16:40.042 --> 00:16:45.464
- We are in a hurry and the boy is fine, anyway.
- The doctor will decide that for himself.


00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:49.760
Let's smash the window!


00:16:48.508 --> 00:16:52.888
First you run over a kid and then you run away?


00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.561
Don't let these idiots go!


00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:07.402
- We've got a very important job to do!
- Everybody shut up! We're leaving now!


00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:11.323
- What the hell is this?
- What did you say, bitch?


00:17:11.323 --> 00:17:14.659
Hank says we are in a hurry and
Abdul says we go! Understand?


00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:18.121
Are you stupid? Don't let these idiots go!


00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.041
You gotta hit it!


00:17:21.041 --> 00:17:23.752
On the ignition?


00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.601
Tell me... how is your leg?


00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:41.686
It's OK.


00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:44.189
The pain is gone?


00:17:43.021 --> 00:17:45.774
Yeah, the pain's gone!


00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:49.611
Good!


00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:51.696
Little motherfucker!


00:17:56.076 --> 00:17:59.204
- Step back!
- Don't move, assholes!


00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:15.971
Is the surgery over?


00:18:15.971 --> 00:18:19.850
Yeah, you're in heaven.
I'm god and this is Petrus.


00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.393
Salam Aleikum!


00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:21.393
Oh shit!


00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:30.485
Excuse us, can you tell us where the exit is?


00:18:30.485 --> 00:18:33.613
Over there on the left.


00:18:34.239 --> 00:18:37.367
Did you see that?
They've got the same car as us!


00:19:50.232 --> 00:19:53.068
Where did you get the gun?


00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:56.196
It was in the glove compartment.


00:19:57.155 --> 00:20:00.242
Glove compartment?


00:20:00.242 --> 00:20:02.536
What car is this, anyway?


00:20:02.536 --> 00:20:05.664
That is a Mercedes 230 SL baby-blue.


00:20:07.582 --> 00:20:10.335
I mean who does it belong to?


00:20:10.335 --> 00:20:13.088
I have no idea - we stole it!


00:20:14.756 --> 00:20:18.593
You mean I was involved in the theft of a car?


00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:21.221
You could say that.


00:20:21.221 --> 00:20:24.683
- I can't remember anything!
- You helped pick it out.


00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:28.103
- Martin Brest, right?
- Yes, the one from the hospital.


00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:31.523
Shouldn't we get going?
We are on our way to the ocean.


00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:35.193
You have never been there,
so we decided to go.


00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.658
I think I don't want to go.


00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:44.453
Then you can't talk about it up there!


00:20:44.453 --> 00:20:47.622
Yes, I know, I also want to go to the ocean,
but...


00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.168
... I am afraid.


00:20:53.462 --> 00:20:55.505
Let me tell you:


00:20:55.547 --> 00:20:59.176
You don't have to be afraid.


00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:05.307
Didn't I tell you:
Nobody was to leave the fucking car?


00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:11.146
Didn't I tell you idiots
not to take your eyes of the car?


00:21:12.814 --> 00:21:14.816
Didn't I?


00:21:14.816 --> 00:21:17.527
Yes, you did, boss!


00:21:17.527 --> 00:21:20.655
Why didn't you do it, then?


00:21:21.073 --> 00:21:23.867
There was this boy...


00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:26.912
I don't want to hear any more bullshit!


00:21:26.912 --> 00:21:30.040
I could kill both of you!


00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.168
I mean, I have the right to do so!


00:21:33.377 --> 00:21:37.756
But I want my car back and
therefore I'm giving you another chance.


00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:42.344
Bring the car back and the
two motherfuckers that stole it!


00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:45.472
And make it quick!


00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:48.600
Do you understand?


00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.798
Good morning!


00:22:25.512 --> 00:22:28.098
85.70 please!


00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.143
I know, but unfortunately I have no money
with me.


00:22:31.143 --> 00:22:35.439
Oh, you are driving a big Mercedes,
but you don't have any money?


00:22:35.439 --> 00:22:38.567
Then give me your pyjamas!


00:22:46.158 --> 00:22:49.828
It seems we've got a problem here.


00:23:05.135 --> 00:23:07.345
Should I be afraid or something?


00:23:07.345 --> 00:23:10.223
Martin! Don't be stupid!


00:23:10.265 --> 00:23:13.143
Finally there is someone with a good idea!


00:23:13.185 --> 00:23:18.690
Put the gun away! I don't want to be
involved in this. It's armed robbery!


00:23:22.444 --> 00:23:26.615
Oh no! Just forget what I said!


00:23:26.615 --> 00:23:30.035
- Rudi, go back to the car!
- No, I won't!


00:23:30.035 --> 00:23:33.205
At this moment it is just armed - something-,
since I didn't take anything!


00:23:33.205 --> 00:23:33.205
But you plan to do it!


00:23:33.205 --> 00:23:35.374
Boys!


00:23:35.374 --> 00:23:38.502
- Just a second!
- We don't have money...


00:23:38.502 --> 00:23:38.502
Boys!


00:23:38.502 --> 00:23:42.672
- One moment! We shouldn't do it!
- Why not?


00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:42.672
It's against the law!


00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:44.716
BOYS!


00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:44.716
WHAT?


00:23:44.716 --> 00:23:51.848
Just a hint - before my fingers fall asleep -
maybe you should plan your robberies beforehand!


00:23:51.848 --> 00:23:54.976
You're starting to get on my fucking nerves!
This gun is real!


00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:59.147
I believe you, but what can you
really do to me anyway?


00:23:59.481 --> 00:24:06.988
It is now 10:58am. At 11am, my friend will
come by and he is a policeman.


00:24:06.988 --> 00:24:10.075
He always comes at 11am.


00:24:10.075 --> 00:24:19.167
He walks in and checks if everything is alright,
drinks a "Jaegermeister" and then he leaves again.


00:24:19.167 --> 00:24:22.295
IF everything is alright...


00:24:23.547 --> 00:24:25.465
Where is Klaus?


00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:27.384
Who is Klaus?


00:24:27.426 --> 00:24:32.597
Every morning at 11am I come in here
and Klaus is there instead of you.


00:24:33.014 --> 00:24:35.517
Oh, Klaus!


00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:38.019
He's sick.


00:24:45.444 --> 00:24:50.115
Perhaps you are telling the truth
and he really is ill-


00:24:53.368 --> 00:24:55.871
- what car is this?


00:24:55.871 --> 00:24:59.541
That is a Mercedes 230 SL baby-blue.


00:24:59.624 --> 00:25:02.502
Baby-blue?


00:25:02.502 --> 00:25:05.380
Who owns it?


00:25:08.175 --> 00:25:11.303
You're a tough customer!


00:25:12.345 --> 00:25:15.474
Hey, wait a sec!


00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:19.853
Me and Rudi stole this car yesterday!


00:25:19.853 --> 00:25:21.730
Who is Rudi?


00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.607
Rudi Wurlitzer!


00:25:23.607 --> 00:25:29.321
We want to go to the ocean and we didn't
have a car. What could we have done? Walk?


00:25:29.654 --> 00:25:32.574
And Klaus is really not ill.


00:25:32.574 --> 00:25:37.788
Well, maybe up there, since he wanted my pyjamas!


00:25:40.082 --> 00:25:45.295
But now he is sitting down here
with a gun pointed at his head!


00:26:01.853 --> 00:26:04.064
That's a good one!


00:26:04.064 --> 00:26:06.149
Really good!


00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.863
My drink is on the house, like always!


00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:14.700
No, it's 2.50!


00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:20.956
Maybe you can get away with this with Klaus,
since he is your friend. But with me you gotta
to pay 2.50.


00:26:55.574 --> 00:26:58.076
Good day, gentleman!


00:26:58.076 --> 00:27:00.579
What can I do for you?


00:27:00.662 --> 00:27:00.579
How much is this car?


00:27:00.662 --> 00:27:04.958
That is a Mercedes 230 SL - 170 HP.


00:27:04.958 --> 00:27:08.086
How much is it?


00:27:08.295 --> 00:27:10.672
The way it is now?


00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:16.428
Leather seats, special paint,
stereo radio - with CD player!


00:27:17.345 --> 00:27:20.515
How much?


00:27:21.099 --> 00:27:25.270
Since you are a foreigner
and foreigners have a hard time in Germany...


00:27:25.687 --> 00:27:27.147
75,000!


00:27:27.189 --> 00:27:31.860
Are you playing us for a sucker?
That is a used car!


00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.531
I know, but it's a rare item
and rare items cost a lot.


00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:40.827
But first we sign the papers.


00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:47.084
Do you have money?


00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:50.212
Not enough!


00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.465
Lets bump this motherfucker!


00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:55.008
Bump him OFF!


00:27:55.008 --> 00:27:57.719
Bump him off and take the car!


00:27:57.719 --> 00:28:00.305
Can you hold the car until tonight?


00:28:00.347 --> 00:28:03.475
Sure!


00:28:08.063 --> 00:28:10.524
That looks great on you, Rudi!


00:28:10.565 --> 00:28:13.235
Maybe you should try on the red one again?


00:28:13.276 --> 00:28:15.987
I will, but I think I will take this one!


00:28:20.033 --> 00:28:24.079
If you plan to rob this shop too, I'm
outta here! Got it?


00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:26.164
Sure!


00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:30.669
- Am I allowed to smoke here?
- Of course!


00:28:33.797 --> 00:28:37.175
How much for all of this?


00:28:37.175 --> 00:28:40.595
Your suit alone is 2,300.


00:28:41.513 --> 00:28:43.598
2,300?


00:28:46.017 --> 00:28:49.104
I'll have to pick up some cash first.


00:28:49.438 --> 00:28:52.566
But this is... about...


00:28:53.942 --> 00:28:57.029
3,000- for now


00:28:58.613 --> 00:29:01.950
These are most amazing clothes I have ever worn.


00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.329
Just a few Marks from the gas station -
they are a gas company, they won't even notice!


00:29:06.329 --> 00:29:06.329
Right!


00:29:06.329 --> 00:29:10.917
I'll go and get some money now, ok?


00:29:39.071 --> 00:29:41.531
Sorry, we're on lunch break.


00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:43.992
Lunch break is cancelled today!


00:30:08.892 --> 00:30:12.104
You have to say something or
nothing will happen here!


00:30:12.145 --> 00:30:15.357
You got 3 seconds:
Someone will tell me what I want or...


00:30:15.982 --> 00:30:19.111
Let's just say that this is
not a water pistol!


00:30:21.113 --> 00:30:23.198
You want all the money!


00:30:25.283 --> 00:30:28.912
100 Marks for you, the rest goes in the bag!
Hurry up!


00:30:30.372 --> 00:30:32.457
Excuse me...


00:30:33.792 --> 00:30:35.043
What?


00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:41.717
I know it's a stupid question, but
usually my customers don't turn up in pyjamas...


00:30:46.304 --> 00:30:49.474
Without shoes even!


00:30:51.435 --> 00:30:56.648
Hi, my name is Martin Brest!
As you can see I am robbing your silly bank!


00:30:56.648 --> 00:31:00.902
And just because I picked out this suit,
but I can't afford it!


00:31:00.944 --> 00:31:05.073
You can stop babbling:
They don't record the audio anyway.


00:31:05.615 --> 00:31:08.744
80,000!


00:31:21.673 --> 00:31:24.801
Hank! Look at that guy!


00:31:26.887 --> 00:31:29.389
What about him?


00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:32.517
Look at the amazing suit he is wearing!


00:31:34.394 --> 00:31:36.688
Come on!


00:31:36.688 --> 00:31:38.440
I'll take the black one!


00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.068
That should be enough!
Come on, Rudi!


00:31:41.068 --> 00:31:44.196
You can keep the rest!


00:31:44.696 --> 00:31:47.866
I think we can lower our hands now...


00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:49.701
Hands up!
This is a robbery!


00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:52.871
What are you looking at assholes?
Gimme all your money or you're dead!


00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:55.957
You've arrived too late, by one minute...


00:32:29.324 --> 00:32:33.495
- This red thing looks completely silly!
- Stop bitching...


00:32:35.414 --> 00:32:38.500
Red is your colour!


00:33:02.816 --> 00:33:04.359
What's in the bag?


00:33:04.401 --> 00:33:06.153
Just come on!


00:33:06.153 --> 00:33:09.781
Tell me what's in there,
or I'll stay right here.


00:33:50.155 --> 00:33:52.240
60... 70...


00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.785
75!


00:33:54.785 --> 00:33:57.329
75,000!


00:33:58.497 --> 00:34:01.625
And I am wearing this ridiculous red thing!


00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.170
We'll buy you a new one.


00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.298
What? We'll buy you a new one!


00:34:08.298 --> 00:34:10.384
Or two?


00:34:23.522 --> 00:34:28.735
Trinidad! Tierra del Fuego! Bora-Bora! Hawaii!


00:34:29.986 --> 00:34:34.157
Even some places we can't pronounce!


00:34:41.873 --> 00:34:46.044
Actually, I only want to go to the ocean.


00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:35.761
Do you really believe we will be sitting on
a cloud and talk about the ocean?


00:35:40.474 --> 00:35:43.602
Yes, I really do!


00:36:02.871 --> 00:36:04.331
Boss!


00:36:04.373 --> 00:36:06.625
This just came in from Wiesbaden!


00:36:06.666 --> 00:36:08.960
Martin Brest is a Snow White!


00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.796
Oh, you mean...


00:36:10.796 --> 00:36:13.715
No, he is not in our files!


00:36:13.757 --> 00:36:16.885
So why did he crack up then?
He's never done anything and now:


00:36:16.885 --> 00:36:20.013
bank robbery, gas station...


00:36:20.305 --> 00:36:23.225
And what about the car, this Mercedes...?


00:36:23.225 --> 00:36:23.225
Nothing.


00:36:23.225 --> 00:36:27.729
And now guess why!


00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.820
Just put out a search warrant, Keller!


00:36:35.112 --> 00:36:37.447
OK, boss!


00:36:37.447 --> 00:36:39.825
And, Keller?


00:36:41.368 --> 00:36:43.453
Nothing...


00:37:05.892 --> 00:37:09.020
One million!


00:37:09.938 --> 00:37:12.774
And you, like an idiot, are robbing banks!


00:37:12.774 --> 00:37:15.861
One million! This is a lucky car!


00:37:19.031 --> 00:37:22.117
And now?


00:38:07.913 --> 00:38:11.041
If you need something else,
just ring for me.


00:38:14.461 --> 00:38:16.546
What?


00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.965
Oh, yes.


00:38:23.345 --> 00:38:26.473
Thank you. I hope you enjoy your stay!


00:38:29.684 --> 00:38:32.854
Thank you very much!


00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:44.282
Hey! Where are you going?


00:38:44.324 --> 00:38:46.368
I quit!


00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:59.423
Is there something you can tell me?
Except that you turned this place upside down?


00:38:59.423 --> 00:39:02.551
Of course!
Look what I found!


00:39:02.676 --> 00:39:06.096
This is for a check-up in the hospital.
In half an hour. We can make it there!


00:39:06.096 --> 00:39:09.224
- That was yesterday!
- Oh, we might be late then.


00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:18.400
Two number fifteens, please.
Is there anything else you can recommend?


00:39:20.152 --> 00:39:22.988
Oh yes - what is it?


00:39:22.988 --> 00:39:26.116
I see. Two ice-creams then.


00:39:28.618 --> 00:39:31.747
And, one bottle of...


00:39:31.747 --> 00:39:36.960
No, two bottles of "Cuvee Dom Perignon" -
and two glasses please!


00:39:38.128 --> 00:39:39.171
Ten minutes?


00:39:39.963 --> 00:39:41.006
Okay, thanks.


00:39:41.965 --> 00:39:45.093
Oh, and a French dictionary please!


00:39:47.512 --> 00:39:50.098
Of course, boss!


00:39:50.098 --> 00:39:52.684
Yes Franky...


00:39:52.726 --> 00:39:55.854
The cops are after the car, too...


00:39:56.146 --> 00:39:59.274
We are listening to the cops radio...


00:39:59.358 --> 00:40:02.527
You can rely on us, Franky - 120 percent!


00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:08.658
Yes, 120 percent...


00:40:09.493 --> 00:40:12.621
Yes, today.


00:40:19.586 --> 00:40:22.214
What did Franky say?


00:40:22.214 --> 00:40:26.385
Franky says: "If you morons don't find the car
before the cops do -


00:40:26.385 --> 00:40:28.970
- something bad will happen to you!"


00:40:29.012 --> 00:40:31.598
But what can happen? Franky is harmless!


00:40:31.598 --> 00:40:31.598
Are you kidding?


00:40:31.598 --> 00:40:37.979
I heard Franky once bit someone�s balls off,
that owed him money.


00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.066
And he swallowed them!


00:40:41.733 --> 00:40:44.778
Ahhh! That was delicious!


00:40:44.778 --> 00:40:47.864
Now tell me: What was it?


00:40:48.073 --> 00:40:51.201
Bull testicles!


00:40:51.618 --> 00:40:55.789
- You are saying we ate the balls of a bull?
- Seems so...


00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:05.382
Let's hope the ice cream was
really ice cream!


00:41:18.729 --> 00:41:21.648
- How many do you have?
- Eight.


00:41:21.648 --> 00:41:24.151
- Eight?
- Yes, how many do you have?


00:41:24.151 --> 00:41:27.070
Twenty


00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:31.241
Do you remember that the doctor said that
you only have a few days left?


00:41:35.412 --> 00:41:39.583
Maybe we should pick just one wish -
the most important one!


00:41:44.171 --> 00:41:47.299
That's difficult... I don't want to decide.


00:41:48.884 --> 00:41:53.555
Let's do it this way: You pick a number from
my list and I pick one from yours.


00:41:53.889 --> 00:41:56.975
- Okay. Who starts?
- You!


00:41:56.975 --> 00:42:00.145
You have twenty... then I take number...


00:42:01.563 --> 00:42:04.733
One! I take number one!


00:42:06.193 --> 00:42:08.945
That's the Cadillac for my mother.


00:42:08.945 --> 00:42:11.698
- "Cadillac for your mother"?
- Yes.


00:42:11.823 --> 00:42:15.994
A Cadillac Fleetwood -
like the one Elvis bought for his mother.


00:42:17.412 --> 00:42:21.583
My mother is the biggest Elvis fan in the world.


00:42:21.833 --> 00:42:28.090
When I was a small boy I was sitting in front of the TV
with my mother, when we saw it.


00:42:30.759 --> 00:42:34.930
My mother was sitting there and she cried.


00:42:36.098 --> 00:42:41.311
And since then it was my biggest wish
to buy one for her, too.


00:42:42.437 --> 00:42:45.565
But I never had the money...


00:42:46.108 --> 00:42:49.236
That is a good wish


00:42:51.738 --> 00:42:53.824
I like it.


00:42:56.952 --> 00:43:00.080
Now it's your turn. Pick a number.


00:43:00.789 --> 00:43:03.583
You had eight - so I take seven -


00:43:03.583 --> 00:43:06.336
No, I'll take number one, too.


00:43:07.796 --> 00:43:10.924
Can't we pick something else?


00:43:22.394 --> 00:43:24.688
That's your wish?


00:43:24.688 --> 00:43:26.982
Your number one wish?


00:43:26.982 --> 00:43:30.110
Yes, it's not as good as the
Cadillac for your mother, but...


00:43:30.736 --> 00:43:32.487
"Fuck two women at once".


00:43:32.529 --> 00:43:34.281
No: "Sleep with them"!


00:43:34.281 --> 00:43:37.409
"Fuck"! - You want to "fuck" them.


00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:42.497
- That's how you say it in your language!
- That's how you say it in every language!


00:43:42.539 --> 00:43:47.502
"To sleep": That is to close your eyes
and turn around.


00:43:47.544 --> 00:43:50.672
The thing you want to do is: "Fuck"!


00:45:05.831 --> 00:45:08.959
Martin! Wake up!


00:45:10.836 --> 00:45:13.088
What's wrong?


00:45:13.088 --> 00:45:15.340
The police!


00:45:28.228 --> 00:45:32.441
Put your guns away, or
I will kill the hostage!


00:45:44.703 --> 00:45:46.788
Take off your clothes!


00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:57.090
Did you catch the bandits?


00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.009
Do I look like Batman?


00:45:59.009 --> 00:46:00.677
- Are you the manager?
- Yes.


00:46:00.677 --> 00:46:05.891
They want to blow up the entire hotel.
We'll call the SWAT team!


00:46:16.818 --> 00:46:19.988
Nice car, isn't it?


00:46:20.572 --> 00:46:22.574
This is our car!


00:46:22.574 --> 00:46:27.245
- Your car?
- Yes, officer, it was stolen.


00:46:27.371 --> 00:46:29.539
- Too bad.
- Yes, bad things happen...


00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:34.753
Things happen? The two motherfucking
thieves are probably in that hotel!


00:46:35.087 --> 00:46:34.753
Probably!


00:46:35.087 --> 00:46:38.423
Is this your car?


00:46:38.423 --> 00:46:43.095
Here is the key!
Never leave it on the sun visor again!


00:46:46.431 --> 00:46:47.516
See?


00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:56.358
I am coming soon, lads!


00:47:01.029 --> 00:47:04.199
That were nice fucking cops!


00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.537
I knew that I could rely on you!


00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:14.209
Well done!


00:47:24.803 --> 00:47:27.973
Where is the case?


00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:29.808
Which case?


00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:32.978
The case with my money is gone!


00:47:33.395 --> 00:47:35.439
We don't know anything about a case.


00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:44.823
There was a case with a million that I owe to
Curtis and now you motherfuckers owe it to me!


00:47:45.991 --> 00:47:48.702
But where can we get a million?


00:47:48.702 --> 00:47:52.330
Why are you asking me? Go to the bank!
Play the lottery! Ask your mothers!


00:47:52.372 --> 00:47:56.501
But the fucking cops stole it.
They are all corrupt!


00:47:59.129 --> 00:48:01.298
Corrupt!


00:48:01.339 --> 00:48:04.426
- See?
- I know!


00:48:22.778 --> 00:48:26.948
- Is something wrong?
- Your driver's license and registration, please!


00:48:30.702 --> 00:48:32.788
registration...


00:48:33.205 --> 00:48:35.290
driver's license.


00:48:36.249 --> 00:48:39.294
- The car is almost new?
- Not even one year old.


00:48:39.294 --> 00:48:41.880
- How many kilometres?
- Less than 30,000.


00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.466
- Have you been in the army?
- 4 years.


00:48:44.508 --> 00:48:46.093
- Yes or No?


00:48:46.093 --> 00:48:47.719
Yes, sir!


00:48:47.719 --> 00:48:49.304
Are there problems with the radiator?


00:48:49.304 --> 00:48:51.640
- Who?
- The car!


00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.975
No. Everything's fine.


00:48:54.476 --> 00:48:58.647
I think everything is fine here, too.
He is destined for the mission!


00:48:59.064 --> 00:49:00.732
What mission?


00:49:00.732 --> 00:49:03.902
Get out of the car!


00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.325
Come with me.


00:49:11.076 --> 00:49:17.332
This is a special mission. We picked you
because we think you are destined to do it.


00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:21.420
Really?
Can I get some money out of it?


00:49:22.129 --> 00:49:24.089
We are doing it for the government.


00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:24.089
Yes, sir!


00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:27.008
Mr. Schneider! Hello, Mr. Schneider!


00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:29.094
Inspector Schneider!


00:49:33.098 --> 00:49:37.769
Well, Mr. Inspector Schneider, I just wanted to
tell you that Brest now stole a police car!


00:49:38.103 --> 00:49:40.772
Couldn't you wait until I am back in the office?


00:49:40.814 --> 00:49:43.942
And there is something else!


00:49:45.068 --> 00:49:46.737
What is it? Should I guess?


00:49:46.737 --> 00:49:48.905
- You'll never guess!
- Keller!


00:49:48.947 --> 00:49:52.034
- The other one - Wurlitzer - he is a hostage!
- Hostage!?


00:49:52.075 --> 00:49:55.203
Yes, he threatened him with a gun!
He wanted to kill him!


00:49:56.747 --> 00:49:58.832
How did you get to the police, by the way?


00:49:58.832 --> 00:50:00.876
I used the bus!


00:50:00.876 --> 00:50:02.878
Authorization...


00:50:02.919 --> 00:50:04.963
Document...


00:50:21.563 --> 00:50:25.317
Allowing for all possibilities,
they couldn't have gotten further than this!


00:50:25.317 --> 00:50:27.194
Well done, Keller!


00:50:27.194 --> 00:50:28.862
Do you want to earn some points?


00:50:28.862 --> 00:50:31.615
- Sure, boss!
- Initiate a police search there!


00:50:31.615 --> 00:50:34.409
Keller, you will get us a hubi.
We'll fly there!


00:50:34.409 --> 00:50:35.994
Heli!


00:50:35.994 --> 00:50:37.621
Sorry?


00:50:37.621 --> 00:50:39.998
The official abbreviation for
"helicopter" is "heli"!


00:50:39.998 --> 00:50:43.168
I don't fucking care what it is called
as long as it flies!


00:51:07.234 --> 00:51:09.319
Put your hands behind your head and
step back from the car!


00:51:09.319 --> 00:51:09.319
What?


00:51:09.319 --> 00:51:13.073
Your hands! Behind your head!
I am a police officer!


00:51:13.073 --> 00:51:15.242
Me too!


00:51:15.283 --> 00:51:17.452
Come here - I need your help!


00:51:17.452 --> 00:51:19.204
I have a small problem with
the radiator...


00:51:19.204 --> 00:51:22.374
I filled it with water, but the engine is overheated!


00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.714
I haven�t got a clue about cars!
Can I see your police ID, please?


00:51:28.714 --> 00:51:32.884
Listen to me: I am a special representative
of the Department of the Interior.


00:51:32.884 --> 00:51:36.012
I am delivering a document
to the chancellor�s office!


00:51:36.012 --> 00:51:40.183
It would be best for everyone, if you
would let me use your helicopter, now!


00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.729
Can I see the authorization?


00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:54.781
I thought that police cars never break down...


00:51:57.284 --> 00:52:00.203
...never go bust...


00:52:00.203 --> 00:52:02.497
Everything alright, colleague?


00:52:02.497 --> 00:52:05.625
Everything alright!
You can join us in the helicopter!


00:52:11.048 --> 00:52:14.176
There will be consequences!


00:52:39.409 --> 00:52:41.495
Rudi!


00:53:27.666 --> 00:53:29.584
Do you have this!?


00:53:29.584 --> 00:53:31.420
Excuse me, please!


00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:34.256
You will need a prescription.


00:53:34.256 --> 00:53:37.884
Don't be ridiculous!
It's a matter of life and death!


00:53:37.926 --> 00:53:42.097
- I'll pay as much as you want!
- I can't, it's a very strong drug!


00:54:43.492 --> 00:54:46.620
Load your weapons!
Take your stand!


00:54:47.454 --> 00:54:49.539
Off you go!


00:54:51.833 --> 00:54:54.961
Boss, you have to see this!


00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:58.298
"...we don't know if people
were injured or killed..."


00:54:58.298 --> 00:55:01.426
"...we will now switch to our reporter,
she is on the scene..."


00:55:01.426 --> 00:55:03.095
Do you want to marry me, Keller?


00:55:03.095 --> 00:55:06.223
"I am knockin' on heavens door!
I've got nothing to loose!"


00:55:06.223 --> 00:55:06.223
This guy is sick!


00:55:06.223 --> 00:55:10.519
"Fuck off!"


00:55:12.771 --> 00:55:15.941
"Hey, I want you to fuck off!
You got two minutes!"


00:55:16.525 --> 00:55:18.735
"That was about 10 minutes ago."


00:55:18.735 --> 00:55:24.991
"The police withdrew and the kidnapper
Martin Brest fled into this Turkish diner."


00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:26.743
Why do I learn this from TV?


00:55:26.785 --> 00:55:34.042
"The psychopathic Martin Brest kidnapped
Rudi Wurlitzer on Monday night from a hospital."


00:55:34.584 --> 00:55:36.670
She doesn't have any tits!


00:55:45.846 --> 00:55:48.432
Snipers!


00:55:48.473 --> 00:55:51.059
They probably got snipers on the roof!


00:55:51.059 --> 00:55:54.187
If they had snipers,
you wouldn't be standing there!


00:55:56.898 --> 00:56:00.027
But I am the hostage!


00:56:00.652 --> 00:56:03.780
They wouldn't kill the hostage - would they?


00:56:04.197 --> 00:56:07.325
That's happened before.


00:56:26.178 --> 00:56:29.347
[Turkish]


00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:38.940
The "Helsinki Syndrome" describes a change
in the relationship between the hostage and
the kidnapper.


00:56:39.524 --> 00:56:44.780
A radical, unconscious change
of the hostage's survival strategy.


00:56:45.364 --> 00:56:53.538
After some time in panic, the hostage starts to
seek the trust and friendship of the kidnapper.


00:56:53.538 --> 00:56:57.709
But he is still violently following his goals.


00:56:57.876 --> 00:57:01.838
What goal?
That's bullshit!


00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:06.051
Mr Schneider, please let me do the
psychological study!


00:57:06.218 --> 00:57:12.474
You can study whatever you want, but these
two guys are playing us for a sucker!


00:57:14.893 --> 00:57:18.021
It's OK, you don't have to pay!


00:57:25.404 --> 00:57:29.574
Listen, I can't give you change for that...
This is not a bank.


00:57:30.117 --> 00:57:32.202
That's alright


00:57:40.335 --> 00:57:42.421
They are coming out!


00:57:50.762 --> 00:57:53.348
I am sorry, but I need your car!


00:57:53.348 --> 00:57:56.518
- Get into the car, baby face!
- Don't ever call me baby face again!


00:57:56.518 --> 00:57:59.604
In the other side!


00:58:00.439 --> 00:58:03.608
Get closer!


00:58:05.360 --> 00:58:08.488
We're on air!


00:58:08.905 --> 00:58:13.160
"When leaving the diner, Brest threatened
a woman and took her car."


00:58:13.201 --> 00:58:19.458
"Brest, who seems to be ready for anything,
robbed a bank the other day for 80,000 Marks."


00:58:19.958 --> 00:58:22.961
Not to mention my million!


00:58:22.961 --> 00:58:27.966
"We do not know what he did to Wurlitzer,
but we hope that the hostage is ok."


00:58:28.008 --> 00:58:34.222
"We will be back as soon as there are more news.
Celia Sarto for TVL2."


00:58:36.141 --> 00:58:39.227
Corrupt cops, yes...


00:58:40.062 --> 00:58:41.146
SHIT!


00:58:42.564 --> 00:58:45.734
The guy had my suitcase!


00:58:47.152 --> 00:58:50.739
Get Carlos and the Rodriguez brothers and...


00:58:50.739 --> 00:58:53.825
GET MY MONEY BACK!


00:59:19.935 --> 00:59:24.106
Boss, they stole a car and
are heading for the Dutch border now.


00:59:24.606 --> 00:59:28.777
Tell our people to follow and observe them,
but without attracting attention!


00:59:35.659 --> 00:59:39.830
Are they stupid?
Aren't they afraid that you could kill me?


00:59:56.388 --> 00:59:59.558
You just lost your driver's license!


01:02:13.191 --> 01:02:16.778
If I knew this would happen,
I would have gone to school for another job!


01:02:16.778 --> 01:02:19.865
You went to SCHOOL for this shit???


01:02:24.036 --> 01:02:26.246
We lost them!


01:02:26.246 --> 01:02:29.374
We really lost them!


01:03:09.331 --> 01:03:12.417
They're gone!
These idiots are lucky, too!


01:03:12.417 --> 01:03:15.545
Too much luck for my taste!
You will now take over from here!


01:03:15.587 --> 01:03:19.758
You are now responsible here, Keller!
Now you have to show me that you are a cop!


01:03:22.552 --> 01:03:25.681
Yes, boss!
I'll get them!


01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:29.017
I'll get you motherfuckers!


01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:34.022
Boss! Boss!


01:03:49.454 --> 01:03:50.080
Hello!


01:03:49.454 --> 01:03:54.126
What are you doing! Get out of my car!
If there is a problem come to my window!


01:03:54.167 --> 01:03:58.296
That's not possible,
since everybody could see my gun then!


01:03:59.047 --> 01:04:01.007
Don't make a mistake!


01:04:01.049 --> 01:04:04.136
You can put your hands down.


01:04:05.512 --> 01:04:07.055
Do you know me?


01:04:07.097 --> 01:04:09.141
No.


01:04:11.643 --> 01:04:13.729
Open this!


01:04:24.281 --> 01:04:31.371
I am married, we don't have children yet,
but my wife is pregnant...


01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:34.499
Hey, that's good for you!
Congratulations!


01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:40.005
Now listen to me: This is 80,000 Marks,
which I robbed from the bank.


01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:46.595
And this is about 3,000 Marks,
which I robbed from the gas station.


01:04:47.095 --> 01:04:50.265
I want you to give the money back!
Can I count on you?


01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:53.268
- Yes, of course.
- Good.


01:04:53.268 --> 01:04:56.396
That should clarify the situation
with your people.


01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:59.066
If I see a cop from now on -


01:04:59.066 --> 01:05:01.610
I will kill the hostage!


01:05:08.367 --> 01:05:09.743
Everything fine?


01:05:08.367 --> 01:05:12.871
- Yes, we are debt-free!
- That sounds good to me!


01:05:28.929 --> 01:05:32.057
Off you go, TJ!


01:05:32.265 --> 01:05:35.394
If you need a taxi again: 2727!


01:05:39.981 --> 01:05:43.110
Good day, gentlemen!
What can I do for you?


01:05:44.236 --> 01:05:47.280
Have we met before?


01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.574
No.


01:05:49.574 --> 01:05:52.703
We want to buy a Cadillac!


01:05:53.328 --> 01:05:57.499
Just like the one that Elvis bought
for his mother.


01:06:00.502 --> 01:06:02.587
No problem!


01:06:17.853 --> 01:06:20.939
"HOSTAGE-DRAMA:
Doomed kidnaps doomed"


01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:49.634
- Hempel, Amelia-Elisabeth: 10,000 Marks
- What's the street?


01:06:49.634 --> 01:06:55.891
- I told you: Huehnerbeinstrasse!
- Ha, that's a strange name for a street...


01:06:57.225 --> 01:07:00.395
OK, put the letters in the mail now.


01:07:08.612 --> 01:07:11.615
Hey, what are you planning?


01:07:11.656 --> 01:07:16.828
A Cadillac for you, two women for me...
At least I have to invite them for dinner!


01:08:05.127 --> 01:08:07.003
Hello Mom!


01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:12.634
Martin?


01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:23.395
My boy!


01:08:29.818 --> 01:08:32.988
What happened to you?


01:08:49.129 --> 01:08:52.257
Where have you been for so long?


01:08:53.717 --> 01:08:56.845
Look at what I brought for you!


01:09:11.526 --> 01:09:14.696
It's beautiful!


01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.370
I don't even have a driver's license!


01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:28.627
And you're not even Elvis...


01:09:39.805 --> 01:09:42.307
Come on Brest! The game is over!
Drop the gun!


01:09:42.307 --> 01:09:45.102
Get inside mom!


01:09:45.143 --> 01:09:48.230
- What is going on?
- Drop the gun, Brest!


01:09:50.315 --> 01:09:53.485
Or I'll shoot!


01:09:53.568 --> 01:09:56.279
- Martin, do what he says!
- I can't do that, Rudi!


01:09:56.279 --> 01:09:58.365
Drop the gun!


01:09:58.365 --> 01:10:01.284
The ocean is not so important now!
I will see it eventually!


01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:04.413
Yes, you will see it! But what about me!?


01:10:22.431 --> 01:10:25.600
Well done, Brest!


01:10:28.687 --> 01:10:30.772
Let me go!


01:10:35.777 --> 01:10:40.365
You are a liar! You tell me about the ocean,
but you have never been there yourself!


01:10:40.407 --> 01:10:45.620
- Arrest the son-of-a-bitch!
- What? This man is dying! He is seriously ill!


01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:50.792
Get an ambulance, or you
will have to arrest him in heaven!


01:11:01.136 --> 01:11:03.221
I will go with him.


01:11:03.221 --> 01:11:07.184
What? You are going with him?
After all he has done to you?


01:11:07.184 --> 01:11:13.440
I know the doctor! I know the hospital!
He is my friend and I will take care for him!


01:11:17.819 --> 01:11:20.947
Helsinki Syndrome!


01:11:20.947 --> 01:11:24.076
You go with them!


01:13:39.544 --> 01:13:44.216
- Is that a brothel or a chorus line?
- Nobody else knows either...


01:13:44.216 --> 01:13:45.967
It's a brothel!


01:13:47.052 --> 01:13:47.969
What?


01:13:47.052 --> 01:13:50.055
A brothel!


01:14:17.999 --> 01:14:19.960
What about you?


01:14:20.001 --> 01:14:23.130
Hey, it's your wish, Rudi!


01:14:36.018 --> 01:14:38.020
Can I have two...?


01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:41.273
You can have them all -
when you got enough money!


01:15:02.210 --> 01:15:06.923
Are you done already?
Then take care of the toilettes now!


01:15:07.299 --> 01:15:10.761
No, I don't think we will
clean the toilettes today, boss!


01:15:10.761 --> 01:15:12.512
You don't think so?


01:15:12.554 --> 01:15:15.640
And why don't you think so, Abdul?


01:15:17.017 --> 01:15:20.145
They are here!


01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:35.077
Didn't you like it, Rudi?


01:15:35.369 --> 01:15:38.497
Oh, I did...


01:15:38.997 --> 01:15:42.167
But you look so sad.


01:15:44.836 --> 01:15:48.632
There are so many undone things in my life,


01:15:48.632 --> 01:15:51.760
so many things unsaid...


01:15:52.803 --> 01:15:55.931
You know...


01:15:57.474 --> 01:16:00.602
That was probably the greatest fuck of my life!


01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:07.984
And your last!


01:16:19.037 --> 01:16:23.208
Good! Now, that we're all together...


01:16:25.127 --> 01:16:28.255
Where is my money?


01:16:29.589 --> 01:16:31.258
What money?


01:16:31.258 --> 01:16:35.429
Don't fuck with me!
Tell me where my money is!


01:16:35.846 --> 01:16:38.974
And I will spare your life!


01:17:10.255 --> 01:17:12.591
What's so funny?


01:17:12.591 --> 01:17:14.926
Actually nothing...


01:17:14.926 --> 01:17:18.096
I see...
Where did we leave off?


01:17:19.222 --> 01:17:22.351
Yes... the money.


01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:27.773
We mailed it to various people.
There is nothing left.


01:17:33.945 --> 01:17:37.074
Why are you making it so hard for me?


01:17:38.116 --> 01:17:40.994
Unfortunately I have to kill you now!


01:17:41.036 --> 01:17:47.292
Go for it! I will die soon anyway.
I've got a cerebral tumour, I don't care!


01:17:50.087 --> 01:17:53.215
Then I will kill you!


01:17:53.215 --> 01:17:55.384
I don't want to piss you off, but...


01:17:55.384 --> 01:18:01.056
I've got bone cancer, late stage,
I don't care either!


01:18:01.056 --> 01:18:03.642
SHUT UP!


01:18:03.642 --> 01:18:06.770
I'll kill you now!


01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:36.712
Here we are...


01:20:39.005 --> 01:20:42.134
Can you taste the salt?


01:20:46.304 --> 01:20:49.433
Rudi?


01:20:51.226 --> 01:20:54.312
I've got to tell you something!


01:20:56.314 --> 01:21:00.485
I know.
But let me tell you something:


01:21:02.571 --> 01:21:05.699
You don't have to be afraid!


01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:20.894

Hey, what's going on?


01:28:09.873 --> 01:28:12.167
Where did this come from?


01:28:12.167 --> 01:28:12.167
From Santa Claus?


01:28:12.167 --> 01:28:16.421
From Santa Claus? No!
There was a letter in my mailbox!


01:28:17.297 --> 01:28:18.715
In your mailbox?


01:28:17.297 --> 01:28:20.842
From Rudi and Martin!


01:28:21.259 --> 01:28:24.346
- From Rudi and Martin?
- That was written on it!


01:28:24.471 --> 01:28:27.599
I don't even know them!
I promise!


01:28:27.724 --> 01:28:36.066
Supposed you are telling the truth
and this was in your mailbox-


01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:38.735
- who the fuck are Rudi and Martin?
